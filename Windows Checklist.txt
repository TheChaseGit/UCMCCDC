Change Passwords (good idea to write what you change the password to down)
net user
net user username newpassword
Configure Firewall (cmd as admin)
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles firewallpolicy blockinbound,allowoutbound
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
Example of allowing incoming based on port
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow RDP" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389
And to verify the example
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="Allow RDP"




Check for and remove or uninstall any services and programs that are not needed to minimize attack surface.


View what is listening, stop things that do not need to be there
netstat -ano


sc query state=active


net stop sshd
